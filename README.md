Hand-Sign: Multi-class Classification CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification of hand signs. The model is trained to recognize and classify various hand gestures commonly used in sign language or gesture-based interfaces.

Features
Deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

Supports classification of multiple hand-sign classes

Preprocessing pipeline: image resizing, normalization, and augmentation

Training, validation, and testing scripts included

Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Dataset
A labeled dataset of hand-sign images with multiple gesture classes. You can use a public dataset such as:

American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Dataset

Or your own custom dataset
